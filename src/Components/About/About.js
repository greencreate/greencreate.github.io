            in a diverse range of media including painting, neon, and acrylic
            resin. Thomas has exhibited at galleries, museums, and institutions,
            and recently participated in group exhibitions at Christieâ€™s, New
            York (2020), Local Project, New York (2020), The Center for
            Holographic Arts x Plaxall Gallery, New York (2019), Cluster
            Gallery, New York (2019), Greenpoint Gallery, New York (2019), and
            Blackbird Gallery, New York (2019). Thomas was trained in painting
            at Parsons School of Design and Pratt Institute, and is a graduate
            of New York University.
